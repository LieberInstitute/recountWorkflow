# recount workflow: accessing over 70,000 human RNA-seq samples with Bioconductor

## Abstract

The recount2 resource is composed of over 70,000 uniformly processed
human RNA-seq samples spanning TCGA and SRA, including GTEx. The
processed data can be accessed via the recount2 website and the
`recount` Bioconductor package. This workflow explains in detail how to
use the `recount` package and how to integrate it with other
Bioconductor packages for several analyses that can be carried out with
the recount2 resource. In particular, we describe how the coverage count
matrices were computed in recount2 as well as different ways of
obtaining public metadata, which can facilitate downstream analyses.
Step-by-step directions show how to do a gene level differential
expression analysis, visualize base-level genome coverage data, and
perform an analyses at multiple feature levels. This workflow thus
provides further information to understand the data in recount2 and a
compendium of R code to use the data.

## Workflow locations

The workflow is available on Bioconductor at
<https://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/recountWorkflow/> and
F1000Research at <https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1558/v1>.

## Documentation

For more information about `recountWorkflow` check the vignettes
[through Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/recountWorkflow)
or at the [documentation
website](http://LieberInstitute.github.io/recountWorkflow).

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `recountWorkflow` using
from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("recountWorkflow")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('recountWorkflow')` in
R. Please run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite
**recountWorkflow**.

``` r
print(citation('recountWorkflow'), bibtex = TRUE)

```

Please note that the `recountWorkflow` was only made possible thanks to
many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either
in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
